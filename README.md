This repository contains data and code (scripts and notebooks) associated with Ford and Rose (submitted 2025). 
Files are organized by the figure/notebook they are used for.
The netCDF files used to make Figures 2 and 4 are too large to store on GitHub. The netCDF file containing the main Southern Ocean LFCA result is included on Zenodo, and the other processed data is available upon request.
